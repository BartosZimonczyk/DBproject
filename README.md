# DBproject
This is our project for DB classes at college. You need a PyQt5 and psycopg2 python library to run it.
Inserts to the database are kinda random since they were generated by a simple python script. 
The password to the database is now different so code itself won't work. 
If you want to run it, you have to change thoose.
